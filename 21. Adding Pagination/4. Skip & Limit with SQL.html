Combined with the <code>OFFSET</code>&nbsp;command (which replaces <code>skip()</code>), you can control how many items you want to fetch and how many you want to skip.</p><p>When using Sequelize, the official docs describe how to add pagination:&nbsp;<a href="https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html</a></p>
